Jovian has three different "workflows" which can be used to analyse your data.

Jovian currently supports two "data-types", namely Illumina-data and Nanopore-data.

{==pls add more :)==}

## Illumina data

For Illumina data, Jovian currently has two different workflows which can be used to analyse the raw data.  

- The [Jovian Illumina-Metagenomics workflow](Illumina/Metagenomics.md)
- The [Jovian Illumina-Reference-based workflow](Illumina/Reference.md)

Both Illumina workflows take raw (basecalled and demultiplexed) Illumina NGS data as input from human clinical matrices.

## Nanopore data

For Nanopore data, Jovian currenly has one workflow available which can be used to analyse the raw data.

The [Jovian Nanopore-Reference-based workflow](Nanopore/Reference.md)

The Nanopore reference-based workflow takes raw (basecalled and demultiplexed) Nanopore FASTQ data as input. The Nanopore workflow is currently not able to process fast5 data from Nanopore.
